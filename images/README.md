     My name is PAVANI GORLAGUNTA, I am from India. I did my bachelor’s in computer science and I learned java, c language, python programming skills, database, and many other subjects which was very interesting. And now I am currently pursuing masters in sunny new Paltz. In my leisure time I usually like to watch tv, reading books, playing games, surfing internet. One of the funniest parts about me is that i love travelling a lot also doing painting and sketching. My favourite website is Geeks for Geeks and LeetCode.

    I had a very good computer experience. Computer is the thing from which we can do any activity and very easy, we can do any complex things in computer. I’m proficient with Microsoft office, word excel, java programming. I’m very comfortable using these programs and have a lot of experience doing so. I am comfortable using computers and, I am confident in my ability to learn any new programs. I can create fully functional spreadsheets and am familiar with organizing large sets of data.

    My undergraduate was computer science. I have not done any courses. But got to learn basic for c, python, and java language. I tried writing java and c language when I was in my under graduation. The project which I did in my undergraduate was the “scalable framework for stylometric analysis” in this project, I worked on data science using R-programming which is an object-oriented programming language also the programming language and software environment is for statistical, computing and graphs.

    In my 2nd semester, I have done a project and I have made one fitness tracker app by using Vue and it was a very interesting application where I can calculate activities, calories, and how much time people do exercise. It was a really very interesting app which I created. Also, I learned new techniques to write code in Vue using visual studio code.

    Also, in my cybersecurity course, I have done projects like network reconnaissance, SQL injection, cross-site request forgery, threat modelling and buffer overflow. These all projects were very realistic and interesting to do I used virtual box for this and some sort of code to hack and how to protect our computers from hackers who can steal our information from our systems.

    Also, in my 3rd semester I have did project on “collaborative online system (COS)” using JavaScript and html and CSS where I had made a website for people who can study through online with the help of online teachers. Where students can login and register and can join the class whenever there tutors are available online, along with this I have created drop down menu for viewing the data, adding the data, set status for the data, editing the data and deleting the data all this coding I did using JavaScript, bootstrap, CSS and html code to design this wonderful website.

    I see myself as a server-side programmer after learning this course. It is very interesting to learn JavaScript and learn how to access and manage database for a website. And, I see myself learning html and CSS coding which is again very interesting to learn. I also see myself creating dynamic websites.
